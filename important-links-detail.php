          <h5>How Can You Leverage Cost Against Your Ability To Secure Future Work?</h5>
          <p><strong>Meta: Leveraging cost against your ability to secure future work is something that all construction project managers need to know how to achieve.</strong></p>
          <p>When you’re managing construction projects, it can be difficult to get the balance right between costs and reputation. While it can be tempting to quote as low an estimate for project works as possible in order to attract clients and gain more jobs, this can often be a counterproductive approach. 

          <p>Many project managers are under the impression that clients are only interested in securing the lowest priced construction firm to come and complete their work. However, this isn’t necessarily the case. While there will always be some clients who value low prices above all else, there are many more who would prefer to pay a little more for the best quality job. The key to success is to get the balance right when giving your estimates, and to leverage cost against your ability to secure more work in the future. 

          <p>How can you do this? Let’s take a closer look at how you can get the balance right. </p>

          <h5>Costs Are An Issue</h5>
          <p>When you’re working on a project, costs will always be an issue, so it’s pointless to pretend that they won’t. However, they needn’t be the be-all and end-all. Some project managers fall into the trap of quoting a price that is too low in an attempt to ensure that their company is selected for the job by the client. This can be a major error, especially if costs mount up rapidly. Leaving little or no margin means that should a problem arise (and this is all too common in construction projects) the budget can easily be exceeded. This can result in problems with the client who, rightly or wrongly, may protest against being charged large additional sums to rectify the issues that have arisen when the price that they were initially quoted was so low. Of course, quoting a much higher price is also counterintuitive, since it’s likely that the client will go with a company that has charged a lower quote. Leveraging costs against your own skills is the way forward. </p>

          <h5>Harness The Power Of Your Team’s Skills</h5>
          <p>Quoting a higher price is acceptable to many clients as long as you can give good justification for the additional costs. If you can demonstrate your abilities, and the skills of your team, are worth the extra charges, you can convince most clients that it’s worth paying more for a better quality final product.</p>
           
          <p>Cost-centered clients will always be interested in getting the lowest possible price and will be prepared to compromise on quality in order to achieve this goal. But value-centric clients will be looking for the right balance of both quality and price. They want to know that they can get their project done efficiently, quickly, within their desired budget and, most important, completed to the highest possible standard. This is where you can leverage your team’s skills and experience to your advantage. </p>

          <h5>Reducing Overall Costs For The Client</h5>
          <p>Leveraging costs effectively involves convincing the client that you can reduce their overall costs thanks to your team’s abilities and expertise. Although your initial quote may be higher than that offered by some of your competitors, your client needs to realize that your team has the ability to shorten the length of time taken for the project to be completed and, thus, reduce the overall cost of the project. Not only that, but their superior skills and training mean that there are less likely to be snags that need to be rectified at a later date, and less chance of overrun or going over budget due to those problems.</p>
           
          <p>Not only can this reduce the overall costs for the client, but bear in mind that you can also leverage costs for yourself by harnessing the power of your team’s superior skills. Having a talented and efficient team onboard for each construction project will ensure that the job will be completed more rapidly and effectively, so your overall costs will be reduced, and your profits boosted.</p> 

          <h5>Improving Your Reputation</h5>
          <p>Not only will you be reducing costs for yourself and your client, you will also be improving your ability to secure future work by leveraging those costs. When your clients see the quality of the work that you and your team have produced, they will be keen to use your services again for their future projects. They will also be more likely to recommend your company to their friends and acquaintances who require work to be carried out. As a result, your reputation will increase and word of mouth will spread about your quality performance.</p>
          <p>Any project manager who operates within the construction industry understands the importance of a good reputation when it comes to securing contracts in the future. While giving potential clients low estimates may seem to be an effective strategy, in the long-term it can backfire exponentially if costs should exceed the estimate given by a substantial sum. Trying to cut costs in order to meet the quoted amount will also cause your reputation to suffer. Therefore, it makes sense to avoid adopting this strategy since you are risking your ability to secure future work for your company. If word gets around that you cannot remain within budget, or that the work that you complete is substandard, your reputation will inevitably be damaged, perhaps beyond repair. 
          Getting the balance right between costs and quality is therefore vital if you’re to give your company the best possible chance of securing more contracts in the future, and so ensuring that your profitability is maintained in the long-run. Avoid the temptation to underquote, and harness the abilities of your skilled construction teams to carry out high quality work each and every time. This is the best way to leverage costs in order to obtain future work for your business. </p>
